# react-one

### Getting Started

```shell
$ git clone -o upstream https://github.com/CallumVass/react-one.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
$ npm install                   # Install npm packages listed in ./package.json
$ npm install -g webpack        # Only run this if you don't have webpack already installed globally
$ npm run start                     # Will start the server, browse to http://localhost:8081
```

Play around with it, make changes and watch it refresh. So simple.
